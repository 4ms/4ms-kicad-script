##How to use:##

These scripts use the 4ms kicad library for faceplate holes. This is found in the 4ms kicad lib repository [here](https://github.com/4ms/4ms-kicad-lib.git)

The `4ms_Faceplate` library must be installed on your computer for Step 3 to work.

Open `faceplate_footprint_lib.py` and change the path to the location of the `4ms_Faceplate.pretty` folder.
