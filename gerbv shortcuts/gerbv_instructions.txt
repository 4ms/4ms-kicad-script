These scripts and template files work with the gEDA version of gerbv. They are not for KiCAD.

Make a dir called .gerbv in your home dir, and copy the files in templates/ into it:

```
mkdir -p ~/.gerbv
cp templates/* ~/.gerbv/
```

Run the one of the scripts in bin/ while in a directory containing gerber files.
Use `gerbv_fpkicad` if you want it to make the layer colors look like a faceplate, and don't have a back side silk file, or `gerbv_kicad` if you want the layer colors to look like a PCB and have all the layer files for a 2-sided board. 
The script will create a gerbv project file named something like `gerbv_QCDEXP-FACEPLATE.gvp`. After the project file is created, you can just open the gerbv project by calling:

```
gerbv -p gerbv_QCDEXP-FACEPLATE.gvp
```
