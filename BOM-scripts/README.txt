4MS PCBA BOM generation tool is a work in progress

Use pcb_bom_4ms or pcb_bom_4ms_JLCPCB from Kicad Schematic Editor (eeschema) to generate a BOM csv.

To add these scripts to eeschema, click the BOM icon on the toolbar. Then click the plus icon. Select either `pcb_bom_4ms.py` or `pcb_bom_4ms_JLCPCB.py`.

Note that all these files in the folder must remain in a folder together: if you copy them elsewhere, make sure to copy all the files.
